# Summative Assignment ML/DL Project

## Overview
This project analyses student performance using two datasets: Mathematics (`student-mat.csv`) and Portuguese (`student-por.csv`). The notebook applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict outcomes and explore feature importance.

## Folder Structure
- `summative_assignment_notebook.ipynb`: Main project notebook
- `dataset/`: Contains the datasets
    - `student-mat.csv`
    - `student-por.csv`

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Mount Google Drive using:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
3. Ensure your datasets are in `My Drive/summative files/`.
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
