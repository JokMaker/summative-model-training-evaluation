In this project, we use two real-world datasets (`student-mat.csv` and `student-por.csv`) to build predictive models for student final grades. We compare traditional machine learning approaches with deep learning models, aiming to identify the most effective techniques and gain insights into the factors influencing student success.\n",

        "## Literature Review: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Student Performance Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have become central to educational data mining, enabling early identification of students at risk of underperformance. Research shows that academic outcomes are shaped by a combination of demographic, behavioral, social, and emotional factors. Traditional grade monitoring is often reactive, while ML/DL models can proactively analyze multidimensional data to generate early warning signals and support interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naïve Bayes for student performance prediction, with ensemble and hybrid methods often achieving the best results [1][2][3][5][6][8]. Deep learning, especially with neural network architectures like RNNs and LSTMs, has gained traction for modeling complex, non-linear relationships and temporal patterns in educational data [3][9]. Multimodal data fusion and knowledge tracing are emerging trends, integrating diverse data sources and tracking student learning over time [3][9][10].\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these advances, challenges remain. Many studies lack external validation and focus on single-institution datasets, limiting generalizability [6][8]. The timing of predictions, feature selection, and ethical considerations (such as algorithmic bias and data privacy) are ongoing concerns [6][7]. There is also a need for more comparative studies between ML and DL approaches, as well as greater transparency and interpretability in predictive models [3][9].\n",
        "\n",
        "This project addresses these gaps by systematically comparing traditional ML algorithms (scikit-learn) and deep learning models (TensorFlow) on the UCI Student Performance dataset [3][9]. By experimenting with different feature sets and prediction timings, and by documenting all modeling decisions, the project aims to contribute practical insights for early warning systems in education.\n",

        "### Discussion: Bias-Variance, Limitations, and Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis:**\n",
        "*   **Traditional Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest):**\n",
        "    *   **Logistic Regression:** Achieved a validation accuracy of `0.9114` and a test accuracy of `0.9241`. This suggests a well-balanced model, indicating low bias and low variance. The strong performance on both validation and unseen test data, along with a high ROC-AUC (`0.9782`), implies it generalizes well. The `C=10` parameter suggests a preference for less regularization, possibly because the features are well-behaved.\n",
        "    *   **Random Forest:** Showed a higher validation accuracy of `0.9367` but a slightly lower test accuracy of `0.8987`. While good, the drop from validation to test, and typically very high training accuracy (not explicitly shown but characteristic of tree-based models) suggests a tendency towards overfitting. The best parameters (`n_estimators=50`, `max_depth=None`) allow for deeper trees, which can capture complex patterns but also memorize training data. The ROC-AUC was `0.9692`, slightly lower than Logistic Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Deep Learning Models (Sequential and Functional API):**\n",
        "    *   Both the Sequential and Functional API models exhibited clear signs of **overfitting**.\n",
        "        *   **Learning Curves:** The plots for both models show that training loss consistently decreased, while validation loss decreased initially but then flattened out or began to increase after a certain number of epochs. Similarly, training accuracy continued to rise, often reaching very high levels (e.g., ~0.97 for Sequential, ~0.95 for Functional), whereas validation accuracy plateaued or even slightly decreased after reaching its peak (e.g., Sequential val_acc peak around 0.91, Functional val_acc peak around 0.89).\n",
        "        *   **Test Performance:** The final test accuracies for both DL models (`0.8734`) were lower than both Logistic Regression and Random Forest, confirming that they did not generalize as well to unseen data despite performing well on the training set.\n",
        "        *   **Hyperparameters:** The default learning rate of `0.001` and dropout rate of `0.3` were applied. The hyperparameter tuning experiment with different learning rates showed that `lr=0.01` yielded a higher validation accuracy (`0.9241`) compared to `0.001` (`0.8101`) and `0.0001` (`0.7468`). This suggests that the initial `0.001` might have been too slow or too small, leading to underfitting in earlier epochs or not reaching the optimal minima, even as overfitting occurred later. The aggressive `0.01` might have allowed faster learning but potentially more unstable training if not accompanied by stronger regularization. The persistent overfitting despite dropout indicates that a more robust regularization strategy or a simpler model might be needed for this dataset size.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Dataset Limitations:**\n",
        "*   **Class Imbalance:** The target variable (G3 converted to pass/fail) exhibits class imbalance. From the `classification_report` for the test set, there are 26 samples for class 0 (fail) and 53 samples for class 1 (pass). This 1:2 ratio means that models might become biased towards the majority class (pass), leading to good overall accuracy but potentially poorer performance in identifying the minority class (students at risk of failing).\n",
        "*   **Small Dataset Size:** The math dataset contains only 395 entries, which reduces to 394 after outlier removal. After splitting, the training set has 236 samples, and validation/test sets each have 79 samples. This is a relatively small dataset, particularly for deep learning models which typically require large amounts of data to learn complex patterns without overfitting. The limited data makes it challenging for models to generalize effectively and can exacerbate overfitting.\n",
        "*   **Feature Representativeness:** While the dataset includes various demographic, social, and academic features, its predictive power might be constrained by the lack of more granular or diverse features directly related to academic engagement, learning styles, or more specific socio-economic factors. The initial EDA (G3 distribution) shows a heavy skew towards higher grades, which might simplify the classification task for simpler models but could also hide nuanced relationships that more complex models struggle to learn with limited data.\n",
        "*   **Lack of Combined Data Utilization:** The notebook mentions having two datasets (`student-mat.csv` and `student-por.csv`), but the analysis primarily focuses on the `mat_df` dataset. Not leveraging the full available data could be a limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Proposed Improvements (Future Work):**\n",
        "*   **Address Class Imbalance:**\n",
        "    *   **Resampling Techniques:** Implement oversampling methods for the minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling for the majority class to balance the dataset.\n",
        "    *   **Class Weighting:** Assign higher weights to the minority class during model training, especially for deep learning models (`class_weight` parameter in `model.fit()`) and scikit-learn models.\n",
        "    *   **Stratified Cross-Validation:** Ensure that the train-test splits (and any future cross-validation folds) maintain the same class distribution as the original dataset. (This was already performed in the notebook, which is good practice).\n",
        "*   **Advanced Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "    *   **Combine Datasets:** Thoroughly combine `student-mat.csv` and `student-por.csv` after ensuring feature compatibility and handling duplicates (students appearing in both datasets) to increase the overall data size.\n",
        "    *   **Interaction Features:** Create new features by combining existing ones (e.g., `Medu` * `Fedu`, `G1` + `G2`, `traveltime` * `goout`).\n",
        "    *   **Polynomial Features:** For continuous variables, adding polynomial features might capture non-linear relationships.\n",
        "*   **Deep Learning Model Optimization:**\n",
        "    *   **Simpler Architectures:** Given the small dataset, consider simpler neural network architectures with fewer layers and neurons to reduce model capacity and combat overfitting.\n",
        "    *   **Stronger Regularization:** Experiment with higher dropout rates, L1/L2 regularization, or batch normalization layers.\n",
        "    *   **Learning Rate Schedules:** Implement learning rate schedules (e.g., callbacks like `ReduceLROnPlateau` or `CosineDecay`) to fine-tune the learning process and potentially escape local minima.\n",
        "*   **Explore Other Models and Ensemble Methods:**\n",
        "    *   **Gradient Boosting Machines:** Evaluate models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost, which are often robust to overfitting and perform well on tabular data.\n",
        "    *   **Ensemble Learning:** Combine the predictions of multiple models (e.g., vote ensemble or stacking) to leverage the strengths of different algorithms and improve generalization.\n",
        "*   **More Robust Evaluation:**\n",
        "    *   **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Implement K-fold cross-validation for all models to obtain a more statistically reliable estimate of model performance, especially given the small dataset and to reduce the impact of a single train-validation-test split.\n",
        "*   **Error Analysis:** Delve deeper into the misclassified samples. For example, are there common characteristics among students incorrectly predicted as 'pass' or 'fail'? This could reveal blind spots in the model or highlight missing crucial features."

        "    *   Test Accuracy: 0.8734, F1: 0.9074, ROC-AUC: 0.9441. The performance is comparable to the Sequential model, reinforcing the overfitting pattern seen in the learning curves.\n",
        "\n",

        "In summary, traditional ML models (LR, RF) showed good generalization with minor signs of overfitting for RF. Deep Learning models (Sequential, Functional) exhibited clearer signs of overfitting, as indicated by the divergence between training and validation curves. Appropriate hyperparameter tuning, especially for learning rate and regularization (dropout), is crucial to manage this tradeoff in deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Small Dataset Size:** With only 394 samples (after outlier removal), the dataset is relatively small for training deep learning models, which generally benefit from larger datasets to learn complex patterns without overfitting. This small size makes deep models more prone to memorizing the training data.\n",
        "*   **Potential Class Imbalance:** We classified G3 as pass/fail. If there's a significant imbalance between passing and failing students, models might be biased towards the majority class. The `y_class` distribution should be checked. (`stratify=y_class` was used in train-test split, which helps, but doesn't resolve inherent imbalance).\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering:** While one-hot encoding was applied, the features are mostly direct measurements. More domain-specific feature engineering (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features) could potentially capture more complex relationships that simpler models might miss.\n",
        "*   **Categorical Encoding:** `pd.get_dummies` with `drop_first=True` was used, which is generally good, but for some categorical variables, a different encoding (e.g., target encoding) might be beneficial depending on the cardinality and relationship with the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Proposed Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **More Robust Hyperparameter Tuning for DL Models:** Instead of just a few learning rates, use a more systematic approach like `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` (if feasible with TensorFlow wrappers or Keras Tuner) to explore learning rate, number of layers, number of units per layer, and dropout rates.\n",
        "2.  **Cross-Validation:** For the small dataset, k-fold cross-validation could provide a more reliable estimate of model performance and reduce the variance associated with a single train-validation-test split, especially for the traditional ML models.\n",
        "3.  **Regularization Techniques for DL:** Experiment with stronger regularization for the Deep Learning models, such as L1/L2 regularization on kernel weights, increasing dropout rates, or batch normalization layers to combat overfitting.\n",
        "4.  **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) as they often provide superior performance by combining multiple weaker models and are less prone to overfitting than single complex models.\n",
        "5.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use feature importance techniques (e.g., from Random Forest or SHAP values) to understand which features are most predictive of student performance. This can guide further feature engineering or selection.\n",
        "6.  **Data Augmentation (if applicable):** If there were any related forms of data (e.g., time-series attendance records, textual data), augmentation could be explored, although less straightforward for this tabular dataset.\n",
        "7.  **Address Class Imbalance:** If class imbalance is significant, techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or using class weights in the loss function could improve performance for the minority class."

        "2.  **Cross-Validation:** For the small dataset, k-fold cross-validation could provide a more reliable estimate of model performance and reduce the variance associated with a single train-validation-test split, especially for the traditional ML models.\n",

        "2.  **Cross-Validation:** For the small dataset, k-fold cross-validation could provide a more reliable estimate of model performance and reduce the variance associated with a single train-validation-test split, especially for the traditional ML models.\n",

        "4.  **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) as they often provide superior performance by combining multiple weaker models and are less prone to overfitting than single complex models.\n",
        "5.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use feature importance techniques (e.g., from Random Forest or SHAP values) to understand which features are most predictive of student performance. This can guide further feature engineering or selection.\n",

        "*   **Potential Class Imbalance:** We classified G3 as pass/fail. If there's a significant imbalance between passing and failing students, models might be biased towards the majority class.

        "*   **Feature Engineering:** While one-hot encoding was applied, the features are mostly direct measurements. More domain-specific feature engineering (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features) could potentially capture more complex relationships that simpler models might miss.\n",
        "*   **Categorical Encoding:** `pd.get_dummies` with `drop_first=True` was used, which is generally good, but for some categorical variables, a different encoding (e.g., target encoding) might be beneficial depending on the cardinality and relationship with the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Proposed Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **More Robust Hyperparameter Tuning for DL Models:** Instead of just a few learning rates, use a more systematic approach like `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` (if feasible with TensorFlow wrappers or Keras Tuner) to explore learning rate, number of layers, number of units per layer, and dropout rates.\n",
        "2.  **Cross-Validation:** For the small dataset, k-fold cross-validation could provide a more reliable estimate of model performance and reduce the variance associated with a single train-validation-test split, especially for the traditional ML models.\n",
        "3.  **Regularization Techniques for DL:** Experiment with stronger regularization for the Deep Learning models, such as L1/L2 regularization on kernel weights, increasing dropout rates, or batch normalization layers to combat overfitting.\n",
        "4.  **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) as they often provide superior performance by combining multiple weaker models and are less prone to overfitting than single complex models.\n",
        "5.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use feature importance techniques (e.g., from Random Forest or SHAP values) to understand which features are most predictive of student performance. This can guide further feature engineering or selection.\n",
        "6.  **Data Augmentation (if applicable):** If there were any related forms of data (e.g., time-series attendance records, textual data), augmentation could be explored, although less straightforward for this tabular dataset.\n",
        "7.  **Address Class Imbalance:** If class imbalance is significant, techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or using class weights in the loss function could improve performance for the minority class.\n"

        "**Deep Learning Models (Sequential and Functional API):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Sequential DL Model:**\n",
        "    *   Looking at the training history plots, the training accuracy consistently increased, reaching very high levels (e.g., >0.95), while the validation accuracy plateaued or even slightly decreased after some epochs (around 0.9114 at epoch 26 in the provided logs, but best weights restored likely led to 0.8734 on test). The gap between training and validation accuracy widens, and validation loss starts to increase while training loss continues to decrease. This is a classic indication of **overfitting**. The model is learning the training data too well, including its noise, and failing to generalize to unseen validation data. The `dropout_rate=0.3` was used, which helps, but might not have been sufficient.\n",
        "    *   Test Accuracy: 0.8734, F1: 0.9038, ROC-AUC: 0.9398. This is lower than both LR and RF, further supporting the overfitting observation. The early stopping mechanism helped mitigate severe overfitting by restoring the best weights, but the potential for overfitting was present during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Functional DL Model:**\n",
        "    *   Similar to the Sequential model, the Functional API model also showed a widening gap between training and validation accuracy and loss curves. Training accuracy again reached high levels (e.g., >0.95), but validation accuracy plateaued (around 0.8987 at epoch 26, test accuracy 0.8734). This also points to **overfitting**. The architecture and hyperparameters (same as Sequential model) likely contributed to similar behavior.\n",
        "    *   Test Accuracy: 0.8734, F1: 0.9074, ROC-AUC: 0.9441. The performance is comparable to the Sequential model, reinforcing the overfitting pattern seen in the learning curves.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact of Hyperparameters (Learning Rate example):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The hyperparameter tuning experiment for the Sequential model with varying learning rates showed a significant impact:\n",
        "    *   `lr = 0.01`: Validation Accuracy: 0.9241 (High accuracy, potentially faster convergence, but also risk of overshooting optimal weights or overfitting quickly)\n",
        "    *   `lr = 0.001`: Validation Accuracy: 0.8101 (Lower accuracy, possibly a better balance, but the specific validation accuracy here might be due to early stopping activating before optimal convergence)\n",
        "    *   `lr = 0.0001`: Validation Accuracy: 0.7468 (Low accuracy, likely underfitting. The model isn't learning effectively or fast enough, remaining in a high-bias state).\n",
        "*   This demonstrates the critical role of learning rate: too high can lead to unstable training or jumping over optimal solutions (and potentially contribute to overfitting), while too low can lead to slow convergence or getting stuck in suboptimal local minima (underfitting).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, traditional ML models (LR, RF) showed good generalization with minor signs of overfitting for RF. Deep Learning models (Sequential, Functional) exhibited clearer signs of overfitting, as indicated by the divergence between training and validation curves. Appropriate hyperparameter tuning, especially for learning rate and regularization (dropout), is crucial to manage this tradeoff in deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Small Dataset Size:** With only 394 samples (after outlier removal), the dataset is relatively small for training deep learning models, which generally benefit from larger datasets to learn complex patterns without overfitting. This small size makes deep models more prone to memorizing the training data.\n",
        "*   **Potential Class Imbalance:** We classified G3 as pass/fail. If there's a significant imbalance between passing and failing students, models might be biased towards the majority class. The `y_class` distribution should be checked. (`stratify=y_class` was used in train-test split, which helps, but doesn't resolve inherent imbalance).\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering:** While one-hot encoding was applied, the features are mostly direct measurements. More domain-specific feature engineering (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features) could potentially capture more complex relationships that simpler models might miss.\n",
        "*   **Categorical Encoding:** `pd.get_dummies` with `drop_first=True` was used, which is generally good, but for some categorical variables, a different encoding (e.g., target encoding) might be beneficial depending on the cardinality and relationship with the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Proposed Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **More Robust Hyperparameter Tuning for DL Models:** Instead of just a few learning rates, use a more systematic approach like `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` (if feasible with TensorFlow wrappers or Keras Tuner) to explore learning rate, number of layers, number of units per layer, and dropout rates.\n",
        "2.  **Cross-Validation:** For the small dataset, k-fold cross-validation could provide a more reliable estimate of model performance and reduce the variance associated with a single train-validation-test split, especially for the traditional ML models.\n",
        "3.  **Regularization Techniques for DL:** Experiment with stronger regularization for the Deep Learning models, such as L1/L2 regularization on kernel weights, increasing dropout rates, or batch normalization layers to combat overfitting.\n",
        "4.  **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) as they often provide superior performance by combining multiple weaker models and are less prone to overfitting than single complex models.\n",
        "5.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use feature importance techniques (e.g., from Random Forest or SHAP values) to understand which features are most predictive of student performance. This can guide further feature engineering or selection.\n",
        "6.  **Data Augmentation (if applicable):** If there were any related forms of data (e.g., time-series attendance records, textual data), augmentation could be explored, although less straightforward for this tabular dataset.\n",
        "7.  **Address Class Imbalance:** If class imbalance is significant, techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or using class weights in the loss function could improve performance for the minority class.\n"

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project systematically compared traditional Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with Deep Learning models (Sequential and Functional API) for predicting student performance. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach given the dataset characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings & Model Effectiveness:**\n",
        "*   **Traditional ML models, particularly Logistic Regression, demonstrated superior generalization ability** on this relatively small, tabular dataset, achieving the highest test accuracy (0.9241) and ROC-AUC (0.9782). This suggests that for datasets of this nature and size, simpler, interpretable models can be highly effective.\n",
        "*   **Random Forest performed strongly** (test accuracy 0.8987, ROC-AUC 0.9692) but showed a slight tendency towards overfitting, indicating its capacity to learn complex patterns, sometimes at the expense of generalization on limited data.\n",
        "*   **Deep Learning models (Sequential and Functional API) consistently exhibited signs of overfitting** (test accuracy 0.8734 for both). Despite efforts with dropout and early stopping, the small dataset size limited their ability to generalize effectively, leading to a divergence between training and validation performance. This underscores that deep learning models require substantial data to unlock their full potential and avoid memorizing noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications for Educational Interventions:**\n",
        "*   The results suggest that **relatively simple and interpretable ML models can be highly effective** for early identification of students at risk of academic underperformance using this type of structured data. These models offer a good balance of predictive power and ease of understanding, which is crucial for actionable educational interventions.\n",
        "*   **Focusing on data quality and feature engineering** (e.g., combining datasets, exploring interaction terms) is likely to yield more benefits than simply adopting more complex models, especially with limited data.\n",
        "*   Future work should prioritize **collecting more diverse and larger datasets** to fully explore the capabilities of deep learning approaches in this domain, while continuing to ensure model interpretability for practical application.\n",
